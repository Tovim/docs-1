= Lit-path! datatype

== Abstract

A `lit-path!` is a quoted or unevaluated path!.

A `lit-path!` value will decay into a path! value when evaluated, such as when entered into the Red REPL.

Lit-path! is a member of the following typesets: `any-block!`, `any-path!`, `series!`

== Creation

`Lit-path!` values can be created using `quote` and literal syntax, or at runtime by using a `make` constructor or `to` conversion.

```red
>> quote 'foo/bar/baz
== 'foo/bar/baz
```

```red
>> make lit-path! [foo bar baz]
== 'foo/bar/baz
```

You can create an empty lit-path of a given size by supplying an integer value as an argument to `make`:

```red
>> make lit-path! 10
== '
```

`To` conversion:

```red
>> to lit-path! "foo bar baz"
== 'foo/bar/baz
```

== Literal syntax

```
<lit-path-literal> ::= '<path-literal>

<path-literal> ::= <path-head>/<selector>
<path-head>    ::= <word-literal> | <path-literal>
<selector>     ::= <integer> | <word-literal> | :<word-literal> | <paren>
```

Selector datatypes: link:integer.adoc[integer!], link:word.adoc[word!], link:get-word.adoc[get-word!], link:paren.adoc[paren!]


== Testing values

Use `lit-path?` to check if a value is of the `lit-path!` datatype.

```red
>> lit-path? first ['foo/bar]
== true

>> lit-path? quote 'foo/bar
== true
```

Use `type?` to return the datatype of a given value.

```red
>> type? first ['foo/bar]
== lit-path!

>> type? quote 'foo/bar
== lit-path!
```
