= Refinement! datatype

== Abstract

A `refinement!` is a symbolic value, like a word!, that is most often used for fine tuning in function specifications. Conceptually, a path is a series of successive refinements, whether for a path! value, or in files and URLs. They are also used to access specific values in objects, and to add flexibility and control when calling functions.


The `repend` function with no refinement:
```red
>> repend ["foo"] [21 * 2]
== ["foo" 42]
```

With the `/only` refinement:

```red
>> repend/only ["foo"] [21 * 2]
== ["foo" [42]]
```

`Refinement!` is a member of the following typesets: `all-word!`, `immediate!`

== Creation

Refinement! values can be created using literal syntax, or at runtime by using a `make` constructor or `to` conversion.

```red
>> make refinement! "foo"
== /foo
```
```red
>> to refinement! 'bar
== /bar
```

== Literal syntax

A forward slash `/` followed by one or more characters from the entire Unicode range, including punctuation characters from the ASCII subset: `! & ' * + - . < = > ? _ | ~``

Illegal characters are control characters, whitespace characters, and punctuation characters from the ASCII subset: `/ \ ^ , [ ] ( ) { } " # $ % @ : ;`

[NOTE, caption=Note]

Using `@` will not raise an error, but will cause the `refinement!` value to be returned as `email!`.

== Comparisons

All comparators can be applied on `refinement!`: `=, ==, <>, >, <, >=, &lt;=, =?`. 

== Testing values

Use `refinement?` to check if a value is of the `refinement!` datatype.

```red
>> refinement? /foo
== true

>> refinement? third [42 "Foo" /bar]
== true
```

Use `type?` to return the datatype of a given value.

```red
>> type? /foo
== refinement!

>> type? third [42 "Foo" /bar]
== refinement!
```
