= Block! datatype

== Abstract

Blocks are used to represent data or code that can be evaluated at any point in time. They are a type of `series!` with no restriction on the type of values that can be referenced.

Blocks are delimited by opening and closing square brackets, separated by spaces.

Values and expressions in a block are not evaluated by default:

----
>> my-block: [print reverse "Hello" 2 * 2 42]
== [print reverse "Hello" 2 * 2 42]

>> my-block
== [print reverse "Hello" 2 * 2 42]
----

The `native!` values `do` and `reduce` are used to trigger the evaluation of expressions in a block.

* `do` evaluates a block and returns the result of the last expression:

----
>> do my-block
olleH
== 42
----

* `reduce` returns a copy of a block, evaluating all expressions:

----
>> reduce my-block
olleH
== [unset 4 42]
----

`Block!` is a member of the following typesets: `any-block!`, `any-list!`, `series!`

== Creation

Block values can be created using literal syntax, or at runtime using a `make` constructor or a `to` conversion.

To create an empty block pre-allocated for 10 elements:

----
>> make block! 10
== []
----

To create a block of 10 elements with initial values set to none:

----
>> append/dup make block! 10 none 10
== [none none none none none none none none none none]
----

Using a `to` conversion:

----
>> to block! {one 2 "three" 4:00}
== [one 2 "three" 4:00:00]

>> to block! "foo 1.23 me@me.com"
== [foo 1.23 me@me.com]

>> to block! 42
== [42]
----


== Literal syntax

A collection of values delimited by opening and closing square brackets, separated by spaces.

`[]`

`[one 2 "three"]`

`[print 1.23]`


Blocks can extend over multiple lines, and can contain other blocks.

----
[one
2
"three"
]

[one 2 "three" [x foo 1.23]]
----


Extra lines, spaces, and tabs are allowed as long as they do not break up values.

Ok: `[42 print "foo"]`

Not ok: `[42 pr   int "foo"]`


== Comparisons

All comparators can be applied on `block!`: `=, ==, <>, >, <, >=, &lt;=, =?`. In addition, `min`, and `max` are also supported.

== Testing values

Use `block?` to check if a value is of the `block!` datatype.

----
>> block? [42]
== true
----

Use `type?` to return the datatype of a given value.

----
>> type? [42]
== block!
----
